# Webhooks

First, webhooks are a utiliy used to send messages to text channels without needing a discord application (like bots).

This is how you can *get the channel webhook url* of your server:

1. Click *Edit channel* in the desired server channel.
2. Go to the *integrations* section
3. Click *Create Webhook*, this will create the webhook.
4. **Dont edit the name or avatar of the webhook.** This won't make something in the plugin.
5. Copy the webhook URL with *Copy webhook url* button.
